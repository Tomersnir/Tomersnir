## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Tomersnir/Tomersnir** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I'm an app and game developer. Coding in a few programming langueges like Java, C#, HTML.
- College student, currently entrolled in a computer science and math degree
- Aiming to make apps and games for phones. And uploading my games for PC, and maybe even other platforms.
